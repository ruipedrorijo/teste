GET
Requests a representation of the specified resource. 
Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect. 
(This is also true of some other HTTP methods.)
[1] The W3C has published guidance principles on this distinction, 
saying, "Web application design should be informed by the above principles,
but also by the relevant limitations."[11] See safe methods below.

POST 
Requests that the server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a 
new subordinate of the web resource identified by the URI. 
The data POSTed might be, as examples, an annotation for existing resources; 
a message for a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list, or comment thread; 
a block of data that is the result of submitting a web form to a data-handling 
process; or an item to add to a database.[12]
Create.

PUT
Requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied URI.
If the URI refers to an already existing resource, it is modified; 
if the URI does not point to an existing resource, then the server 
can create the resource with that URI.[13]
Update.

DELETE
Deletes the specified resource.
